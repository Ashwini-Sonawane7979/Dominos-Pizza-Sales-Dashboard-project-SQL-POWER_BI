Domino's Pizza Sales Project (SQL & Power BI)
Overview
The Domino's Pizza Sales Project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization initiative aimed at examining and interpreting sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. This project leverages SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights to optimize operations, boost sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Project Components
1. Data Acquisition
The first step involves collecting raw sales data, which may include:
* Customer Orders: Details about what customers ordered.
* Product Information: Data about pizza flavors, categories, and sizes.
* Order Dates: Date and time of transactions.
* Transaction Amounts: Total revenue generated per order.
Data sources could include SQL databases, CSV files, or other storage systems.

2. Data Transformation with SQL
SQL is utilized to preprocess and transform the raw data for analysis. This involves:
* Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data inconsistencies.
* Table Joins: Combining data from multiple tables to create a unified dataset.
* Aggregations: Calculating metrics like total sales, average order value, and customer counts.
* Calculated Fields: Creating new fields such as order frequency, time intervals, or customer segmentation.

3. Data Analysis
SQL queries are written to perform in-depth analysis. Key analyses include:
* Top-Selling Pizza Flavors: Identifying the most popular products.
* Sales Trends: Examining sales patterns over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
* Customer Demographics: Understanding customer preferences and behaviors.
* Order Insights: Calculating average order values and transaction frequency.
* Location Performance: Evaluating sales performance across different restaurant locations.

4. Power BI Visualization
Power BI is used to create compelling, interactive visualizations that effectively communicate insights. Visualizations include:
* Sales by Product Category: Bar charts and pie charts showing revenue distribution.
* Time Series Analysis: Line charts tracking sales trends over specific time periods.
* KPI Dashboards: Summaries of critical metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and customer retention rates.

5. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the data analysis and visualizations, key insights and actionable recommendations are provided. Examples include:
* Sales Optimization: Focus marketing efforts on top-selling pizza flavors.
* Trend Exploitation: Launch promotions during peak sales periods to maximize revenue.
* Menu Adjustments: Introduce or remove menu items based on customer preferences.
* Location Improvements: Provide support or training to underperforming restaurant locations.

Dependencies
To complete this project, the following tools and resources are required:
* SQL Database or Data Source: To store and extract raw data.
* Power BI Desktop: For building and visualizing dashboards.

Conclusion
The Domino's Pizza Sales Project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in deriving valuable business insights. 
By leveraging SQL for data preparation and Power BI for visualization,
the project enables data-driven decision-making to enhance sales performance and customer satisfaction.
